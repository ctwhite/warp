;;; warp-distributed-lock.el --- Distributed Lock Client API -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a high-level, client-side API for interacting with
;; the distributed lock manager service provided by the `warp-coordinator`.
;; It abstracts away the complexities of RPC communication, leader
;; discovery, and retry logic, offering a simple and robust interface
;; for acquiring and releasing distributed locks.
;;
;; ## The "Why": The Need for Mutual Exclusion in a Distributed System
;;
;; When multiple processes, potentially on different machines, need to
;; access a shared resource, you need a way to ensure that only one process
;; can access it at a time. A local mutex is insufficient as it only works
;; within a single process. A **distributed lock** is the solution for
;; coordinating actions across an entire cluster.
;;
;; It is a critical primitive for ensuring data consistency, preventing
;; race conditions in distributed workflows, and implementing leader-only
;; tasks.
;;
;; ## The "How": A Client Facade over a Central Coordinator
;;
;; This module does not implement the lock logic itself. Instead, it acts
;; as a clean client facade for the `:coordinator-service`.
;;
;; 1.  **Centralized Authority**: The lock is managed by a central authorityâ€”the
;;     cluster **leader** node (as determined by the `warp-coordinator`). All
;;     requests to acquire or release a lock are sent via RPC to this leader,
;;     which ensures that only one client can hold the lock at any given time.
;;
;; 2.  **Lease-Based Locking**: The locks granted by the coordinator are
;;     typically lease-based (this is an implementation detail of the
;;     coordinator). This means a lock is granted for a specific duration.
;;     This is a safety mechanism that prevents a client that crashes while
;;     holding a lock from blocking the entire system forever; the lease
;;     would eventually expire.
;;
;; 3.  **Safe, Declarative API**: The primary way to use this module is
;;     through the `warp:with-distributed-lock` macro. It is the distributed
;;     equivalent of a local `with-mutex`. It guarantees that a lock is
;;     **always** released after the critical section of code is executed,
;;     even if an error occurs. This is the safest way to use the feature
;;     and prevents accidental deadlocks.

  "Acquire a distributed lock, execute BODY, and ensure release.
This macro provides a safe and idiomatic way to use distributed locks.
It handles acquiring the lock, running the critical section (`BODY`),
and releasing the lock in a `:finally` block to guarantee cleanup.

Arguments:
- `LOCK-NAME` (string): The unique name of the lock to acquire.
- `:timeout` (number, optional): Max time in seconds to wait for the
  lock. Defaults to 30.0.
- `:coordinator-service` (symbol, optional): The variable holding the
  `:coordinator-service` client. Defaults to `coordinator-service`.
- `BODY` (forms): The code to execute while the lock is held.

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise resolving with the result of the last form in
  `BODY`.

Signals:
- Rejects promise with `warp-distributed-lock-error` or
  `warp-distributed-lock-timeout` if the lock cannot be acquired."
