;;; warp-state-manager.el --- Distributed State Management System for Warp -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a unified, distributed state management system
;; for the Warp cluster. It leverages CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated
;; Data Types) principles to ensure state consistency across
;; distributed components without requiring complex coordination.
;;
;; The state manager offers optional persistence through Write-Ahead
;; Logging (WAL) and periodic snapshots, guaranteeing data durability
;; and quick recovery. It also supports an event-driven observer
;; mechanism, allowing components to react to specific state changes
;; with fine-grained notifications. Transactions are supported for
;; atomic, multi-key updates, ensuring data integrity for complex
;; operations.
;;
;; ## Key Features:
;;
;; - **CRDT-based State Synchronization**: Utilizes vector clocks and
;;   configurable conflict resolution strategies (e.g.,
;;   last-writer-wins) to enable seamless, conflict-free state merging
;;   across multiple distributed components. This ensures eventual
;;   consistency without the need for a central coordinator during
;;   normal operations.
;;
;; - **Persistence Layer**: Provides optional Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
;;   for transaction durability and crash recovery. Operations are
;;   appended to a log before being applied to the in-memory state,
;;   allowing for state reconstruction upon restart. Periodic state
;;   snapshots further aid in faster recovery and reduce WAL replay
;;   time.
;;
;; - **Event-driven Observers**: Allows components to register callbacks
;;   that are automatically triggered when specific state paths change.
;;   Observers can define flexible path patterns (including wildcards)
;;   and custom filter functions to receive highly relevant
;;   notifications, promoting a decoupled and reactive architecture.
;;
;; - **Conflict Resolution**: Offers configurable strategies for
;;   automatically resolving conflicts that arise when concurrent updates
;;   occur on the same state entry from different nodes. Current
;;   strategies include `:last-writer-wins` (default) and
;;   `:vector-clock-precedence`.
;;
;; - **State Snapshots**: Enables the capture of point-in-time snapshots
;;   of the entire state manager's contents. These snapshots can be used
;;   for backup, recovery, debugging, or for bootstrapping new nodes in
;;   the cluster. Automatic snapshotting can also be configured.
;;
;; - **Hierarchical State**: Supports nested state paths (e.g.,
;;   `[:worker-123 :health]`) for organizing data, allowing for granular
;;   updates and queries on specific parts of the state tree.
;;
;; - **Transaction Support**: Provides an API for performing multi-key
;;   atomic updates. Operations within a transaction are all applied
;;   successfully or none are, ensuring data consistency even across
;;   multiple state paths. Transactions support rollback on failure.

This function creates a `warp-wal-entry` struct from the provided
operation data and pushes it onto the in-memory WAL buffer. When the
buffer reaches the configured `wal-buffer-size`, it triggers an
asynchronous flush to disk.

Arguments:
- `state-mgr` (warp-state-manager): The state manager instance.
- `entry-data` (list): A property list describing the operation,
  e.g., `(:type :update :path some-path :entry new-entry)`.

Side Effects:
- Appends a `warp-wal-entry` to the `wal-entries` list in `state-mgr`.
- May trigger an asynchronous `warp-state-manager--flush-wal-async`
  if the buffer is full."

  Signature: `(lambda (path old-value new-value metadata))`.
  `path` is in list format, `old-value` and `new-value` are raw data,
  `metadata` is a plist including `timestamp`, `node-id`, `old-entry`,

  "Executes a sequence of state modifications as a single atomic transaction.
This function provides all-or-nothing semantics for complex operations
that involve multiple state changes. The provided `transaction-fn` is
executed, and all state modifications performed via `warp:state-tx-update`
and `warp:state-tx-delete` within it are collected. If `transaction-fn`
completes successfully, all queued changes are committed at once
(applying them to the state, logging, and emitting events). If `transaction-fn`
signals an error, all changes are discarded via rollback, ensuring data
consistency. The transaction execution is protected by the state manager's
global lock.

Arguments:

  transaction is rolled back, allowing the caller to handle the original
  transaction failure.

Side Effects:

- Adds the `warp-state-transaction` to `active-transactions`.

  "Applies a schema migration function to all non-deleted entries in the

state manager over time (e.g., adding a new field, changing a data type).
It iterates through every active entry and applies the provided function

triggering CRDT logic and persistence.

Arguments:

  returns the (potentially transformed) new value. `path` is in list format.

Returns:
- (integer): The number of entries that were migrated (i.e., whose value
  was changed by `migration-fn`).

Signals:
- `warp-state-manager-error`: If `state-mgr` is invalid.

Side Effects:
- Acquires a mutex lock on the state manager for the duration of the
