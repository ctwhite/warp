;;; warp-service.el --- Distributed Service Registry and Discovery -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides the central Service Registry and Discovery system
;; for the Warp framework. It consists of two main components:
;;
;; 1.  A master-side `warp-service-registry` that acts as the
;;     authoritative source for all available service endpoints.
;; 2.  A client-side `warp-service-client` that provides a simple API
;;     for discovering and connecting to those services.
;;
;; This system allows for a decoupled architecture where services can be
;; dynamically added or removed from the cluster and discovered by clients
;; at runtime without hardcoded addresses.
;;
;; ## Architectural Role:
;;
;; - **Master-Side Registry**: The `warp-service-registry` listens for
;;   events from workers that announce, withdraw, or change the health
;;   status of their services. It maintains a real-time, health-aware
;;   catalog of all service endpoints. It also handles direct RPC requests
;;   from clients for endpoint selection and from workers for dynamic
;;   service registration changes.
;;
;; - **Client-Side Discovery**: The `warp-service-client` provides a
;;   high-level function, `warp:service-client-get-endpoint`, which
;;   abstracts away the details of querying the master and selecting a
;;   healthy, load-balanced endpoint.
;;
;; - **Dynamic Lifecycle**: Workers can use the `warp:service-register` and
;;   `warp:service-deregister` macros to manage their services dynamically
;;   throughout their lifecycle, not just at startup.

Fields:

  the service instance to its physical host.
- `health-status`: The last known health of the endpoint's worker.

  "Creates and registers a single service endpoint in the registry catalog.
This is a core helper function used internally by the `warp-service-registry`.
It takes information about a service provided by a worker and translates
it into a `warp-service-endpoint` object, then adds (or overwrites) it
in the backing `warp-registry`. The endpoint is initially marked as
`:healthy`; its health status will be updated by later `worker-health-status-changed`
events.

Arguments:
- `registry` (warp-service-registry): The service registry instance.
- `worker-id` (string): The unique ID of the worker providing the service.
- `address` (string): The network address (host:port) of the worker where
  the service can be reached.
- `service-info` (warp-service-info): The service description provided by
  the worker (contains name, version, commands).

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise that resolves when the endpoint is successfully
  added/updated in the `warp-registry`.

Side Effects:
- Modifies `registry`'s `endpoint-registry` by adding or updating an entry.
- Logs the registration event."

Arguments:

automatically update the catalog and registers RPC handlers to respond
to client discovery requests and worker registration/deregistration calls.

(cl-defmacro warp:service-register (service-name-str &key version commands)
  "Declaratively registers a service and its commands on a worker.
This macro is a convenience for workers to announce the services they
offer. When expanded, it generates code that:
1. Registers the provided `commands` and their `handler-fn`s with the
   worker's local `command-router` (obtained from the `warp-worker--instance`).
2. Sends an asynchronous RPC to the master's `warp-service-registry`
   to inform it about the new service endpoint, including its name,
   version, and supported commands.
This allows for dynamic service provisioning.

Arguments:
- `service-name-str` (string): The unique, logical name of the service
  (e.g., \"compute-service\", \"data-store\").
- `:version` (string, optional): The semantic version of this service
  implementation (defaults to \"1.0.0\").
- `:commands` (list of `(COMMAND-NAME HANDLER-FN-FORM)` pairs): A list
  where `COMMAND-NAME` is a keyword (e.g., `:process-data`) and
  `HANDLER-FN-FORM` is a Lisp form that evaluates to the handler function.
  Each handler function should accept `(command context)`.

Returns:
- A quoted list of the registered command names (keywords).

Side Effects:
- Expands to code that registers RPC command handlers with the local
  `warp-command-router`.
- Expands to code that sends a `:service-register` RPC to the master.
- Requires `warp-worker--instance` to be dynamically bound or globally
