;;; warp-deployment.el --- Pluggable Deployment Strategy Engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides the logic and workflows for orchestrating safe,
;; zero-downtime deployments within the Warp cluster. It is built upon a
;; pluggable **Strategy Pattern** to support multiple deployment types,
;; including traditional **rolling updates** and progressive **canary releases**.
;;
;; ## Architectural Role: The Deployment Orchestrator
;;
;; The architecture is designed for maximum extensibility and ergonomic use. It
;; centers on a single, unified `:deployment-service` that exposes all deployment-
;; related operations.
;;
;; The core of the system is a declarative "define-and-discover" pattern for
;; deployment strategies:
;;
;; 1.  **Definition**: Deployment strategies are defined as self-contained,
;;     declarative blocks using the `warp:defstrategy` macro. This decouples
;;     the strategy's workflow from the core service, allowing new deployment
;;     methods (like blue-green) to be added without modifying existing code.
;;
;; 2.  **Registration**: `warp:defstrategy` automatically registers the new
;;     strategy, its associated workflow, and its documentation in a central
;;     registry, making it immediately available to the system.
;;
;; 3.  **Execution**: A user initiates a deployment by calling the
;;     `:deployment-service`'s `start-deployment` method with a manifest. The
;;     service looks up the requested strategy in the registry and executes its
;;     associated workflow, which orchestrates the deployment by calling the
;;     primitive methods on the `:deployment-service` itself.
;;
;; This design ensures all deployments are **atomic**â€”they either succeed
;; completely or are fully rolled back to their initial state via durable Sagas.

(defvar warp--deployment-strategy-registry

  "A central, global registry for all discoverable deployment strategies.
This registry is the heart of the pluggable architecture. `warp:defstrategy`
populates this registry, and the `:deployment-service` consumes it.

Each entry is keyed by the strategy's name (for example, `:rolling`) and the value is a
property list containing the strategy's metadata: `(:workflow-name SAGA-NAME :doc DOCSTRING)`.")
