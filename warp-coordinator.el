;;; warp-coordinator.el --- Distributed Coordinator Service -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a simplified distributed coordination service
;; for the Warp framework. It offers abstractions for distributed
;; locks, leader election, and basic consensus-driven state
;; synchronization, enabling robust distributed operations.
;;
;; **Important Architectural Note and Limitations**:
;; This implementation relies heavily on `warp-state-manager` for its
;; distributed state persistence. For true, fault-tolerant distributed
;; consensus (e.g., a full Raft implementation that survives power loss
;; of a majority of nodes), `warp-state-manager` would need to be
;; backed by a truly persistent, replicated, and highly available
;; storage system (like Redis, ZooKeeper, or a distributed database)
;; that handles data durability and consistency across restarts.
;;
;; In its current form, if the underlying `warp-state-manager` is
;; purely in-memory and all coordinator nodes restart simultaneously,
;; the distributed state (locks, leader, barriers) will be lost. This
;; coordinator provides *consistency* and *synchronization* for
;; *currently running* distributed operations, but not full
;; *durability* without external persistent state for
;; `warp-state-manager`.
;;
;; ## Key Features:
;;
;; - **Distributed Locks**: Acquire and release named locks across the
;;   cluster. Uses a leader-centric approach built on
;;   `warp-state-manager` for state.
;; - **Leader Election**: A simplified heartbeat-based election
;;   mechanism. Nodes contend for leadership by writing to
;;   `warp-state-manager`.
;; - **Consensus Operations (Simplified)**: Leader-driven state changes.
;;   The leader proposes an update, and followers acknowledge.
;;   (Note: This is NOT a full Raft/Paxos log replication and
;;   consistency).
;; - **Distributed Barriers**: Synchronize multiple workers at a
;;   specific point in a distributed operation.
;;
;; ## Integration Points:
;;
;; - **`warp-state-manager`**: Fundamental for storing shared
;;   distributed state (locks, leader info, barrier counts).
;; - **`warp-rpc` / `warp-transport`**: Used for inter-coordinator
;;   communication (e.g., vote requests, heartbeats, lock/barrier RPCs).
;; - **`warp-event`**: For emitting notifications about leadership
;;   changes, lock status, etc.
;; - **`warp-command-router`**: For registering RPC handlers that process
;;   coordinator-specific commands from other nodes.

(defun warp-coordinator--get-leader-state (coordinator)
  "Retrieves the current leader state from `warp-state-manager`.
The leader state typically includes the current leader's ID, the term
they are serving, and the last heartbeat timestamp. This information is
stored in a well-known path within the shared state manager.

Arguments:
- `coordinator` (warp-coordinator-instance): The coordinator instance.

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise that resolves to a plist like
  `(:id \"leader-x\" :term 5 :last-heartbeat 123.4)` or `nil` if no
  leader info is present in the state manager.

Side Effects:
- Queries the `warp-state-manager`."

This is typically called by a candidate becoming a leader, or a leader
sending heartbeats to assert its leadership. It performs an atomic
update to ensure consistency in the shared distributed state.

Arguments:
- `coordinator` (warp-coordinator-instance): The coordinator instance.
- `leader-state` (plist): The new leader state to write. Must be a
  plist containing at least `:id` and `:term`.

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise resolving to `t` on success of the state
  manager update.

Side Effects:
- Updates the `warp-state-manager`."

If `new-term` is strictly greater than the `coordinator`'s
`current-term`, the coordinator transitions to follower role, clears
its vote for the old term, and updates its term and known leader ID.
This is a critical Raft rule for ensuring term monotonicity and
leader-follower consistency across the cluster.

Arguments:
- `coordinator` (warp-coordinator-instance): The coordinator instance.
- `new-term` (integer): The new term number to transition to.
- `leader-id` (string or nil, optional): The ID of the new leader,

Returns: `nil`.

Side Effects:
- Modifies `coordinator`'s `current-term`, `role`, `voted-for`, and

Arguments:
- `coordinator` (warp-coordinator-instance): The coordinator instance.
- `lock-name` (string): The name of the lock to release.

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise that resolves to `t` if the lock is
  successfully released, or rejects with a `warp-coordinator-lock-failed`
  error on failure.

Side Effects:
- Sends RPCs to the cluster leader.
- Removes the lock from the local `lock-registry` on successful release.
- Logs operation progress and errors."

(cl-defun warp:coordinator-propose-state-change (coordinator key value &key timeout)
  "Proposes a distributed state change.
This operation can only be initiated by the current leader (this node
must be in the `:leader` role). It attempts to update the shared state
in `warp-state-manager` via an RPC to itself (as the leader).
This is a simplified consensus model; it doesn't involve full log
replication or quorum voting for each change, but rather assumes the
leader's direct manipulation of the shared state manager
(which is CRDT-based) reflects its consensus.

Arguments:
- `coordinator` (warp-coordinator-instance): The coordinator instance.
- `key` (list): The path to the state key (e.g., `(:config :my-setting)`).
- `value` (any): The new value for the state key.
- `:timeout` (number, optional): Maximum time (in seconds) to wait
  for the proposal to be applied by the leader. Defaults to
  `warp-coordinator-config-rpc-timeout`.

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise that resolves to `t` if the state change
  is successfully proposed and applied by the leader, or rejects with a
  `warp-coordinator-consensus-failed` or `warp-coordinator-timeout`
  error.

Signals:
- `warp-coordinator-not-leader`: If this coordinator is not the leader.
  (This is a client-side check for this simplified model).

Side Effects:
- Sends an RPC to the cluster leader (which is itself if this node is
  leader).
- Calls `warp:state-manager-update` on the leader to apply the change.
- Logs proposal progress and errors."

This function repeatedly attempts to increment a named barrier's count on

resilient to transient cluster issues.

Arguments:
