;;; warp-transport.el --- Abstract Communication Transport Protocol -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides the `warp:deftransport` macro, a declarative
;; mechanism for defining and registering abstract communication
;; **transports** within the Warp concurrency framework. It sits at
;; the very bottom of the Warp networking stack, abstracting away the
;; complexities of different wire protocols.
;;
;; It allows various underlying transport mechanisms (like named pipes,
;; WebSockets, or raw TCP sockets) to conform to a **unified interface**.
;; This dramatically reduces boilerplate code at higher levels of the
;; Warp stack (e.g., `warp-channel`, `warp-cluster`, `warp-rpc`),
;; simplifying interactions and promoting modularity.
;;
;; ## Core Concepts:
;;
;; - **Abstract Protocol Interface**: Defines a set of standard,
;;   asynchronous operations (e.g., `connect`, `listen`, `send`,
;;   `receive`, `address-generator`) that any communication protocol
;;   should implement. This forms the contract for all transports.
;;
;; - **`warp-transport-protocol` Struct**: A runtime representation that
;;   holds the concrete Lisp functions implementing the abstract
;;   interface for a specific transport (e.g., for `:pipe` or `:tcp`).
;;
;; - **Protocol Resolution**: The transport system can automatically
;;   determine the correct transport implementation based on a matcher
;;   function for network addresses (e.g., "ipc://", "ws://", "tcp://").
;;   This enables scheme-based address resolution.
;;
;; - **Data Security and Efficiency**: Provides optional, transparent,
;;   end-to-end **payload encryption** (via `warp-crypto`) and
;;   **compression** (via `warp-compress`), configured on a
;;   per-connection basis. These features are applied as middleware.
;;
;; - **`warp-transport-connection` Struct**: A central struct that
;;   encapsulates all state for a single logical connection. It includes
;;   a state machine for lifecycle management, a semaphore for send
;;   concurrency control, and detailed metrics.
;;
;; - **State Machine Driven Connections**: Connection lifecycle and valid
;;   transitions (e.g., `:disconnected` -> `:connecting` -> `:connected`)
;;   are strictly managed by an internal finite state machine. This ensures
;;   robust, predictable, and self-healing behavior.
;;
;; - **Message Queuing**: Incoming messages are buffered using `warp-stream`,
;;   providing essential **backpressure** and flow control capabilities,
;;   preventing consumer overload.
;;
;; - **Connection Pooling**: Integrates with `warp-pool` to manage
;;   reusable pools of transport connections for client-side operations.
;;   This improves performance by reducing connection overhead.
;;
;; - **Heartbeats & Auto-reconnect**: Supports configurable heartbeats
;;   for liveness detection and automatic reconnection attempts with
;;   exponential backoff for transient network failures.
;;
;; - **`warp:deftransport` Macro**: The primary tool for transport
;;   authors to declaratively define and register new transport
;;   implementations with the Warp framework.

- `:connection-closed`: Runs asynchronously when a connection transitions
  to the `:closed` state (either gracefully or due to exhaustion of
  retries). Receives `connection` and a `reason` string.
- `:connection-failed`: Runs asynchronously when a connection error
  occurs (e.g., `send` fails, `receive` errors). Receives `connection`
  and the `error` object.

Arguments:
- `HOOK-NAME` (keyword): The name of the hook.
- `FUNCTION` (function): The function (lambda or symbol) to add to the
  hook. Its arguments must match the hook's signature.

(defun warp:transport-close (connection &optional force)
  "Closes the `CONNECTION` gracefully.
This function initiates the shutdown process for a connection.
If the connection is part of a pool, it should generally be returned
to the pool using `warp:transport-pool-return` instead of directly
closed, unless a permanent closure is intended.

Arguments:
- `CONNECTION` (`warp-transport-connection`): The connection to close.
- `FORCE` (boolean, optional): If non-nil, forces immediate closure of
  the underlying raw connection, bypassing graceful shutdown procedures
  or timeouts. Useful for emergency cleanup.

Returns: (loom-promise): A promise resolving to `t` when the connection
  is fully closed and all associated resources are cleaned up.
  If the connection is already `:closing` or `:closed`, the promise
  resolves immediately.

Side Effects:
- Transitions connection state to `:closing` then `:closed`.
- Calls the protocol's `close-fn`.
- Cleans up all associated resources (timers, streams, semaphores, etc.).
- Deregisters the connection from `warp-transport--active-connections`."
