;;; warp-pipe.el --- Named Pipe (FIFO) Transport Implementation -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides the concrete implementation for the `:pipe`
;; communication transport protocol within the Warp concurrency
;; framework. It integrates with `warp-transport.el` to offer a
;; standardized interface for creating and managing named pipes (FIFOs)
;; for inter-process communication (IPC) on a single machine.
;;
;; The implementation leverages standard shell commands (`mkfifo`, `cat`)
;; and Emacs's process management primitives. It is fully integrated with
;; the generic transport layer, inheriting features like state management,
;; message queuing, automatic reconnect, and health checks.
;;
;; ## Key Features:
;;
;; - **Abstract Protocol Implementation:** Registers the `:pipe` protocol
;;   with `warp-transport.el`, providing the full suite of transport
;;   functions (`connect-fn`, `close-fn`, etc.).
;;
;; - **Unified Connection Object:** This module does not use a custom
;;   struct. All pipe-specific data (like reader/writer processes) is
;;   stored within the generic `warp-transport-connection` object.
;;
;; - **Structured Data:** By integrating with the transport layer's
;;   message stream, it transparently supports serialization and
;;   deserialization of Lisp objects.
;;
;; - **Automatic Cleanup:** Comprehensive resource management, including
;;   automatic recovery from orphaned FIFO files on startup and cleanup
;;   on Emacs exit.
;;
;; - **Health Monitoring:** Provides a `health-check-fn` that verifies
;;   process liveness and file integrity.
