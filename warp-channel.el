;;; warp-channel.el --- Inter-Process Communication Channel -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module introduces `warp-channel`, an advanced communication
;; primitive that supports both in-process and cross-process messaging.
;; It functions as a **multi-writer, multi-reader broadcast system** with
;; sophisticated flow control, making it ideal for building complex
;; event-driven and reactive architectures in distributed environments.
;;
;; ## Core Concepts
;;
;; - **Fan-Out/Broadcast**: A channel allows multiple, independent
;;   subscribers to receive the same stream of messages. Crucially,
;;   each subscriber gets its own dedicated `warp-stream`, ensuring
;;   that one slow consumer does not block others. This is vital for
;;   system stability.
;;
;; - **Unified Transport Layer**: Channels are built directly atop the
;;   abstract `warp-transport` layer. This design allows a channel to
;;   operate seamlessly over different communication backends (e.g.,
;;   TCP, IPC pipes, WebSockets) simply by configuring the transport.
;;   The channel itself has no knowledge of specific protocols; it
;;   delegates address parsing and dispatch entirely to `warp-transport`.
;;
;; - **Symmetrical Data Handling**: Messages are automatically
;;   serialized (e.g., to JSON or Protobuf) before being sent over a
;;   transport, and then automatically deserialized on ingress before
;;   being distributed to local subscribers. This simplifies message
;;   passing for users, as they deal only with Lisp objects.
;;
;; - **Resilience**: The deep integration of `warp-circuit-breaker`
;;   provides resilience against failing remote endpoints. If the
;;   underlying transport to a peer experiences repeated failures,
;;   the circuit breaker "trips," preventing continuous hammering
;;   of a dead service and avoiding cascading failures.
;;
;; - **Flow Control & Backpressure**: For transport-backed channels,
;;   an internal `send-queue` buffers outgoing messages. Configurable
;;   `on-backpressure` policies (e.g., `:drop-head`, `:drop-tail`,
;;   `:error`) prevent the channel from being overwhelmed by fast
;;   producers and manage resource consumption gracefully.
;;
;; - **Observability**: Comprehensive runtime statistics
;;   (`warp-channel-stats`) and structured logging provide deep
;;   visibility into the channel's operational health, message flow,
;;   and error rates.

(warp:defconfig channel-config
  "Configuration parameters for a `warp-channel` instance.
These settings control the channel's behavior, performance, and
resilience features.

Fields:
- `max-subscribers` (integer): Maximum number of concurrent subscribers
  allowed per channel. Prevents resource exhaustion from too many
  consumers.
- `send-queue-capacity` (integer): Capacity of the outbound message
  queue for a transport-backed channel. When this limit is hit, the
  `on-backpressure` policy is triggered. Not used for in-memory channels.
- `on-backpressure` (symbol): Policy for a full `send-queue`:
  - `:drop-head`: Discard the oldest message(s) to make room.
  - `:drop-tail`: Discard the newest message(s).
  - `:error`: Reject the `warp:channel-send` operation with an error.
- `enable-health-checks` (boolean): If non-nil, run periodic health
  checks for transport-backed channels to monitor connectivity.
- `health-check-interval` (integer): Interval in seconds between
  periodic health checks. These checks apply to transport-backed
  channels and contribute to the associated circuit breaker's state.
- `thread-pool` (warp-thread-pool or nil): Optional `warp-thread-pool`
  for the background sender thread (`background-sender-thread`).
  If `nil`, `warp:thread-pool-default` is used. This is not used for
  in-memory channels.
- `transport-options` (plist): Options passed directly to
  `warp:transport-connect` or `warp:transport-listen` for
  transport-backed channels (e.g., `:on-connect-fn`, `:on-close-fn`,
  `:serializer`).
- `circuit-breaker-config` (plist or nil): Configuration options for the
  channel's circuit breaker (e.g., `:failure-threshold`,
  `:recovery-timeout`). If `nil`, default circuit breaker config is used.

This function performs essential error management steps: it logs the

transitions the channel to an `:error` state via its FSM (which stops
further operations), and updates error statistics.

Arguments:
- `channel` (`warp-channel`): The channel experiencing the error.
- `error-type` (symbol): A keyword representing the error category
  (e.g., `:transport-setup-failure`).
- `message` (string): A descriptive error message explaining the issue.

Side Effects:
- Logs a fatal error message using `warp-log!`.

(defun warp:channel (name &rest options)
  "Create and initialize a `warp-channel` instance.
This is the main entry point for creating communication channels.
It supports both in-memory channels (for intra-process communication)
and transport-backed channels (for inter-process/network communication),
automatically inferring the mode if not explicitly provided.

Example for an in-memory channel:
  (braid! (warp:channel \"my-local-bus\")
    (:then (my-channel)
      (warp:channel-subscribe my-channel)))

Example for a TCP listening channel:
  (braid! (warp:channel \"tcp://0.0.0.0:9000\" :mode :listen
                        :config-options '(:send-queue-capacity 512)))

Arguments:
- `NAME` (string): A descriptive name for the channel, which also
  serves as its unique address in the global registry (e.g.,
  `\"my-event-bus\"`, `\"tcp://localhost:8080\"`, `\"ipc:///tmp/my-chan\"`).
- `&rest OPTIONS` (plist): A property list of configuration options:
  - `:mode` (keyword, optional): Explicitly set the channel type:
    - `:in-memory`: For local, in-process message distribution.
    - `:listen`: For transport-backed channels acting as a server.
    - `:connect`: For transport-backed channels acting as a client.
    If omitted, inferred from `NAME` (e.g., `\"tcp://\"` implies
    `:connect`).
  - `:config-options` (plist, optional): A plist of options to configure
    the `channel-config` struct (e.g., `:max-subscribers`,
    `:on-backpressure`).
  - Other keys in `OPTIONS` are passed directly to `warp-transport`
    functions (`warp:transport-connect` or `warp:transport-listen`)
    if the channel is transport-backed.

Returns: (loom-promise): A promise that resolves with the fully
  initialized and `:open` `warp-channel` instance. Rejects if channel
  setup fails (e.g., transport error, invalid configuration).

Side Effects:
- Registers the new channel in `warp-channel--registry`.
- Initializes a `warp-state-machine` for lifecycle management.
- For transport-backed channels, starts a `background-sender-thread`
  and sets up health monitoring/circuit breakers."

  "Close a channel gracefully.
This function initiates a graceful shutdown sequence: it transitions
the channel to `:closing` state, which triggers a series of cleanup
operations (stopping background threads, closing streams and transport
connections), and then finally sets its state to `:closed`. Resources
are released cleanly.

Arguments:
- `CHANNEL` (`warp-channel`): The channel instance to close.

Returns: (loom-promise): A promise that resolves to `t` when the channel
  is fully closed and all resources have been released. If the channel
  is already `:closing` or `:closed`, the promise resolves immediately.

Side Effects:
- Emits a `:close` event to the channel's FSM.
- Stops background sender loop.
- Closes send queue and all subscriber streams.
- Closes the underlying transport connection.
- Shuts down the health check poller.
- Removes the channel from the global `warp-channel--registry`."

  "Execute `BODY` with `VAR` bound to a `warp-channel` instance, ensuring
proper creation and graceful closure.
This macro provides a robust way to use channels by abstracting away the
asynchronous setup and guaranteeing resource release even if errors
occur within the `BODY` or during channel creation.

Arguments:
- `VAR` (symbol): A variable to bind the channel instance to within `BODY`.
- `CHANNEL-NAME` (string): The name/address for the channel to create.
- `KEYS` (`&rest plist`): Optional configuration plist for `warp:channel`
  (e.g., `:mode`, `:config-options`).
- `BODY` (forms): The Lisp code to execute with the channel bound to `VAR`.

Returns:
- The value of the last form in `BODY`.

Side Effects:
- Creates a `warp-channel` using `warp:channel`.
- Ensures `warp:channel-close` is called on the created channel via
  `unwind-protect`, even if `BODY` throws an error.
- Waits for the channel to fully close before the `unwind-protect` exits."
