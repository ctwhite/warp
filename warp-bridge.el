;;; warp-bridge.el --- Worker <-> Control Plane Communication Bridge -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides the "bridge" for managing raw worker connections to
;; the cluster's control plane. Its role is narrowly focused on the
;; transport layer, initial worker handshake, and maintaining the
;; authoritative state of each worker in the shared `state-manager`.
;;
;; ## Architectural Role:
;;
;; The bridge is a **leader-only** component. Its lifecycle is managed by
;; the `leader-services-manager` within the `warp-cluster`. It is
;; responsible for:
;;
;; - **Accepting Connections**: Listening for incoming connections from
;;   newly launched worker processes.
;; - **Secure Handshake**: Verifying the cryptographic handshake from new
;;   workers to ensure only authorized processes join the cluster.
;; - **State Maintenance**: Acts as the primary writer to the
;;   `state-manager` for worker-related state (onboarding, health
;;   updates, service registration, deregistration).
;; - **IPC Routing**: Registers the IPC address of each new worker with
;;   the cluster's `ipc-system`, enabling remote promise resolution.
;; - **Event & RPC Handling**: Listens for worker events and handles
;;   leader-bound RPCs, delegating general requests to the main RPC system.

This function is part of the graceful shutdown process for the cluster,

Side Effects:
- Closes the main transport server socket."

This function is critical for the dynamic leader discovery process. When a

address that needs to be published in the `warp-state-manager` for workers
to discover.

Arguments:
- `BRIDGE` (warp-bridge): The bridge instance.

Returns:
- (string): The contact address string (e.g., \"tcp://127.0.0.1:54321\").

Side Effects:
- None.

  the transport server might not yet have an assigned address."

This function stores a Lisp object in the state manager, keyed by a
worker's rank. A worker can then fetch this payload during its startup
sequence to perform custom, rank-specific initialization (e.g., loading
specialized code or configuration).

Arguments:
- `BRIDGE` (warp-bridge): The bridge instance.
- `RANK` (integer): The 0-indexed rank of the worker to target.
- `PAYLOAD` (any): The Lisp object to be stored. This payload should be
  serializable by `warp:marshal`.

Returns:
- (loom-promise): A promise that resolves with the `payload` after it
  has been successfully stored in the `state-manager`.

Side Effects:
