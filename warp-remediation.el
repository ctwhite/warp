;;; warp-remediation.el --- Intelligent Auto-Remediation Engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides the logic and workflow for the Warp system's
;; self-healing capabilities. It implements an intelligent, event-driven
;; auto-remediation system that responds to health degradations by
;; autonomously executing proven repair strategies.
;;
;; ## Architectural Role: The System's Immune Response
;;
;; This module acts as the system's "immune system." It is designed to
;; automatically handle common failures without human intervention,
;; improving uptime and reducing operator toil.
;;
;; It is built around the `auto-remediation-saga`, a durable workflow
;; that is triggered by `:health-degraded` events. The saga is
;; "intelligent" because it first analyzes the failure and consults
;; historical data before selecting the most appropriate, least disruptive
;; remediation pathâ€”from a simple graceful restart to a full node
;; replacement or escalating to a human operator for complex issues.
;;
;; ## Key Enhancements in This Version:
;;
;; - **Pluggable Strategies**: The system now uses a `warp:defremediation-strategy`
;; macro, allowing new, sophisticated remediation plans to be added by
;; plugins without modifying the core engine.
;;
;; - **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior, such as timeouts and thresholds,
;; is now driven by a central `remediation-config` object, making the
;; system fully tunable at runtime.
;;
;; - **Decoupled Engine**: A new `auto-remediation-engine` component is now
;; responsible for listening to health events and triggering sagas,
;; improving separation of concerns.
