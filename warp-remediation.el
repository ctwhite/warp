;;; warp-remediation.el --- Intelligent Auto-Remediation Engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides the logic and workflow for the Warp system's
;; self-healing capabilities. It implements an intelligent, event-driven
;; auto-remediation system that responds to health degradations by
;; autonomously executing proven repair strategies.
;;
;; ## Architectural Role: The System's Immune Response
;;
;; This module acts as the system's "immune system." It is designed to
;; automatically handle common failures without human intervention,
;; improving uptime and reducing operator toil.
;;
;; It is built around the `auto-remediation-saga`, a durable workflow
;; that is triggered by `:health-degraded` events. The saga is
;; "intelligent" because it first analyzes the failure and consults
;; historical data before selecting the most appropriate, least disruptive
;; remediation pathâ€”from a simple graceful restart to a full node
;; replacement or escalating to a human operator for complex issues.

Why: This step abstracts away specific failure details (e.g., a
`cpu-usage` check vs. a `request-queue` check) into general
problem categories that the strategy selector can act upon.

Arguments:
- `self`: The component instance.
- `worker-id` (string): The ID of the failing worker.
- `failure-type` (keyword): The specific reason for the health failure.

Returns:
- (keyword): A failure class, e.g., `:resource-exhaustion`,
  `:performance-degradation`, or `:unknown`."

Why: This is the 'intelligent' core of the saga. It uses the
failure classification and past incidents to choose the most
appropriate and least disruptive fix.

How: It uses a simple ruleset. For example, it chooses a simple
restart for the first sign of resource exhaustion but escalates
to a full replacement if the problem recurs, suggesting a more
persistent issue.

Arguments:
- `self`: The component instance.
- `classification` (keyword): The failure class from the previous step.
- `historical-context` (plist): Data about past failures for this worker.

Returns:
- (keyword): The chosen remediation plan, e.g., `:restart-graceful`."

  healthy, or rejects if it remains unhealthy after a timeout."
