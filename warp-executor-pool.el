;;; warp-executor-pool.el --- Local Sub-Process Execution Pool -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a dedicated, self-contained pool of local Emacs
;; sub-processes (child resources) specifically designed for offloading
;; CPU-bound or potentially blocking tasks within a main `warp-worker`
;; process. It acts as an internal concurrency manager, allowing a single
;; `warp-worker` to process multiple requests in true parallelism.
;;
;; It leverages `warp-pool.el` as its generic resource pool infrastructure
;; and `warp-process.el` for launching the actual sub-processes.
;;
;; ## Key Features:
;;
;; -   **True Parallelism**: Dispatches tasks to separate Emacs processes,
;;     enabling multi-core utilization within a single logical `warp-worker`.
;; -   **Isolation**: Tasks execute in isolated sub-processes; a crash in
;;     one sub-process does not affect others or the main `warp-worker`.
;; -   **Scalable Concurrency**: Configurable pool size (min/max resources)
;;     to match available resources and demand, managed by `warp-pool`.
;; -   **Context Propagation**: Automatically propagates distributed tracing
;;     context (`warp-trace-span`) to sub-resources, ensuring end-to-end
;;     traceability.
;; -   **Flexible Task Execution**: Capable of dispatching various task types
;;     (Lisp forms, shell commands, Docker commands) to sub-resources.
;; -   **Resource Management**: Integrates with `warp-pool`'s idle scaling
;;     and `warp-process`'s resource limits. OS-level resource limits
;;     and user/group sandboxing are applied based on `warp-security-policy`.
;; -   **Communication**: Manages IPC between the main `warp-worker` and
;;     its sub-processes for task submission and result retrieval via
;;     `warp-channel` and `warp-stream`.

This function is passed to `warp:pool-builder`. It launches a local

Side Effects:
- Launches a new Emacs subprocess.
- Stores the subprocess and its IPC address in `resource`'s `custom-data`."

  "Creates and initializes a new local sub-process executor pool.
This function sets up a `warp-pool` instance specifically configured
to manage local Emacs sub-processes for offloading tasks. The pool
will handle launching, monitoring, and tearing down these subprocesses.

Arguments:
- `NAME` (string): A unique name for this executor pool.
- `MAIN-WORKER` (warp-worker): The parent `warp-worker` instance that
  will own this pool. This is used to pass context (e.g., worker ID,
  main worker's security configuration) to the sub-processes.
- `OPTS` (plist): Configuration options for the executor pool, merging
  with `warp-executor-pool-config` defaults. Can include:
    - `:min-size` (integer): Minimum number of sub-processes to keep
      alive in the pool.
    - `:max-size` (integer): Maximum number of sub-processes the pool
      can scale up to.
    - `:idle-timeout` (float): Time in seconds before an idle
      sub-process is scaled down.
    - `:request-timeout` (float): Default timeout for a task submitted

    - `:max-resource-restarts` (integer): Max restarts for a
      sub-process before it's permanently failed by the pool.

Returns: (warp-executor-pool-instance): The new executor pool instance.

Side Effects:
- Creates an internal `warp-pool` instance.
- May launch `min-size` number of sub-processes immediately during
  `warp:pool-builder`'s internal startup.
