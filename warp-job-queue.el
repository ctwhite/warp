;;; warp-job-queue.el --- Enhanced Distributed Job Queue System -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module implements an enhanced, persistent, distributed job queue system
;; for the Warp framework. It defines the dedicated job queue worker and the
;; client-side API for submitting and managing jobs.
;;
;; This enhanced version includes the following improvements:
;; 1.  **Job Priorities**: Supports high, normal, and low priority queues to
;;     ensure important tasks are processed first.
;; 2.  **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed or timed-out jobs with
;;     configurable exponential backoff.
;; 3.  **Job Timeouts**: Monitors running jobs and handles tasks that exceed
;;     their execution time limit.
;; 4.  **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Moves jobs that have failed all retry
;;     attempts to a separate queue for inspection, with automatic cleanup.
;; 5.  **Job Scheduling**: Allows jobs to be scheduled for execution at a
;;     future time.
;; 6.  **Rate Limiting**: Integrates with `warp-rate-limiter` to protect the
;;     queue from being overwhelmed by requests from a single worker.

;;; Configuration

(warp:defconfig job-manager-config
  "Enhanced configuration for the Warp Job Manager.

Fields:
- `redis-key-prefix` (string): A prefix for all Redis keys used by the job queue.
  This helps avoid key collisions if Redis is used by other services.
- `max-retries` (integer): Default maximum number of retries for a job before
  it's moved to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
- `default-timeout` (integer): Default job execution timeout in seconds. If a job
  runs longer than this, it's considered timed out and will be retried/failed.
- `retry-backoff-base` (float): The base factor for exponential backoff delay.
  For example, a base of 2.0 means delays double with each retry.
- `retry-backoff-max` (integer): The maximum delay in seconds between retries,
  preventing excessively long delays for jobs with many retries.
- `worker-timeout-check-interval` (integer): How often (in seconds) the job
  manager actively scans for and reclaims timed-out running jobs.
- `dead-letter-retention-days` (integer): How many days to keep jobs in the
  dead-letter queue before automatic cleanup, preventing indefinite storage of failed jobs."
  (redis-key-prefix "warp:jobs" :type string)
  (max-retries 3 :type integer)
  (default-timeout 300 :type integer) ; 5 minutes
  (retry-backoff-base 2.0 :type float)
  (retry-backoff-max 3600 :type integer) ; 1 hour max delay

;;; Schema Definitions

(warp:defschema warp-job
    ((:constructor make-warp-job))
  "Enhanced job representation with additional fields for advanced features.
This schema defines the structure of a job managed by the Warp Job Queue.

Fields:
- `id` (string): A unique identifier for the job, automatically generated upon creation.
- `status` (keyword): The current state of the job, such as `:pending`, `:scheduled`,
  `:running`, `:completed`, or `:dead`. This dictates its presence in various Redis lists.
- `priority` (keyword): The job's priority level: `:high`, `:normal`, or `:low`.
  High-priority jobs are fetched before lower-priority ones.
- `payload` (t): The user-defined, serializable data that the job needs to process.
  This is the actual work to be done.
- `timeout` (integer): Job-specific execution timeout in seconds. Overrides the
  default timeout specified in `job-manager-config`.
- `max-retries` (integer): Job-specific maximum number of retries. Overrides the
  default set in `job-manager-config`.
- `retry-count` (integer): The current number of times this job has been attempted.
  Increments on each retry.
- `scheduled-at` (float or nil): The Unix timestamp (float-time) for delayed execution.
  If non-nil, the job will be processed only after this time.
- `submitted-at` (float): The timestamp when the job was first created and entered the system.
- `started-at` (float or nil): The timestamp when a worker picked up and began processing the job.
- `completed-at` (float or nil): The timestamp when the job finished processing, regardless of success or failure.
- `worker-id` (string or nil): The ID of the worker currently processing (or last processed) the job.
- `result` (t or nil): The final output or successful return value of a completed job.
- `error` (string or nil): A string representation of the last error message if the job failed."
