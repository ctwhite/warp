;;; warp-connection-manager.el --- Resilient Connection Management for Warp -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a high-level, resilient connection management
;; utility for the Warp distributed computing framework. It operates
;; on top of the abstract `warp-transport.el` layer, adding a crucial
;; layer of intelligence and fault tolerance for network connections.
;;
;; This refactored version manages a **dynamic set of named peer
;; connections**, making it suitable for a variety of communication
;; patterns, including:
;; - **Client-to-leader**: Where clients (e.g., workers) need to
;;   maintain a connection to a dynamically elected cluster leader.
;; - **Peer-to-peer**: For direct communication between distributed
;;   components (e.g., coordinators, event brokers, state managers).
;;
;; It's designed for client components (like workers or other cluster
;; nodes) that need to maintain stable, auto-reconnecting connections
;; to various dynamic server endpoints or other peers.
;;
;; ## Key Responsibilities:
;;
;; 1.  **Dynamic Endpoint Management**: The manager maintains an
;;     internal map of logical **peer IDs** to their network addresses
;;     and their current active connections. Endpoints can be added
;;     or removed dynamically at runtime.
;;
;; 2.  **Connection Liveness & Auto-reconnect**: It orchestrates a
;;     background "maintenance loop" that constantly strives to keep
;;     all registered connections alive. If a connection is lost due
;;     to network issues, server restarts, or other failures, the
;;     manager will automatically attempt to reconnect to that specific
;;     peer's address, ensuring high availability.
;;
;; 3.  **Service-Level Circuit Breaking**: It integrates seamlessly
;;     with `warp-circuit-breaker.el` to wrap all connection attempts.
;;     If a specific endpoint is repeatedly unreachable, a dedicated
;;     circuit breaker for that peer will "trip" (open), preventing
;;     the client from hammering a dead or overloaded service. This
;;     avoids wasting resources on unresponsive targets and allows
;;     the remote service time to recover.

  "Represents a single connection endpoint with its health metadata.
This struct tracks the operational status of a potential server address
that the connection manager is responsible for maintaining a connection to.

Fields:
- `address` (string): The network address of the peer (e.g.,
  `\"tcp://host:port\"`). This is the target for connection attempts.
- `peer-id` (string): The logical ID of the peer at this address (e.g.,
  `\"worker-123\"`, `\"leader\"`). This uniquely identifies a managed
  peer within the `endpoints` hash table.
- `failure-count` (integer): Total number of failed connection attempts
  to this specific address since it was added or last reset.
- `last-failure` (float): Unix timestamp (`float-time`) of the most
  recent failed connection attempt. Used for tracking and backoff logic.
- `health-score` (float): A score from 0.0 (unhealthy) to 1.0 (healthy),
  intended for selection heuristics (e.g., choosing the healthiest
  endpoint from a pool). (Note: Not fully implemented in this version,
  but provides a hook for future enhancements).
- `consecutive-failures` (integer): Number of *consecutive* failed
  connection attempts. This is often used by circuit breakers or
  retry strategies to determine when to back off more aggressively.
- `active-connection` (warp-transport-connection): The live connection
  object if currently active, `nil` otherwise. This is the established
  network channel to the peer."

This struct holds the collection of managed `warp-cm-endpoint`s and
concurrency controls necessary for its operation. An instance of this
struct is typically created per component that needs robust connection
management.

Fields:
- `id` (string): A unique identifier for this manager instance. Used
  internally for logging and distinguishing multiple managers.
- `name` (string): A descriptive name for logging and debugging purposes
  (e.g., \"leader-cm\", \"worker-coordinator-cm\").
- `endpoints` (hash-table): A hash table mapping `peer-id`s (strings)
  to their corresponding `warp-cm-endpoint` structs. This is the core
  registry of all connections managed by this instance.
- `transport-options` (plist): Options passed directly to
  `warp:transport-connect` when establishing new connections (e.g.,
  `:on-data-fn`, `:ssl-enabled`).
- `lock` (loom-lock): A mutex (`loom:lock`) to protect the manager's
  internal state (`endpoints` hash-table, metrics) from concurrent
  access by multiple threads. Ensures thread safety.
- `maintenance-loop-thread` (thread): The background `loom:thread`
  that continuously monitors connection liveness and attempts
  auto-reconnection for all registered endpoints.
- `event-system` (warp-event-system): An optional handle to a
  `warp-event-system`. If provided, the connection manager will emit
  connection status events (e.g., `:peer-connection-ready`,
  `:peer-connection-lost`) to this bus, allowing other components
  to react to network changes."
