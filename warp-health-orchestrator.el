;;; warp-health-orchestrator.el --- Generic Health Check Management System -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a generic, extensible health check orchestration
;; system. It supports multiple health check strategies, aggregation
;; policies, and reactive health state management.
;;
;;
;; ## Key Features:
;;
;; - **Component-Based**: A self-contained component with `:start` and
;;   `:stop` hooks.
;; - **Pluggable Checks**: Supports registration of custom health check
;;   functions.
;; - **Resilient Execution**: Includes built-in timeouts, retries, and
;;   backoff.
;; - **State Aggregation**: Aggregates individual check statuses into an
;;   overall system health report.
;; - **Event-Driven**: Emits events on health status changes.

;;; Configuration

(warp:defconfig health-check-spec
  "Specification for a single, periodic health check.

Fields:
- `name` (string): A unique, human-readable name for this health check.
- `target-id` (string): The ID of the entity this check is monitoring.
- `check-fn` (function): A function `(lambda (target-id))` that performs
  the check and returns a promise.
- `interval` (integer): The frequency in seconds for executing the check.
- `timeout` (float): The maximum time in seconds to wait for `check-fn`
  to resolve before it's considered a timeout failure.
- `retry-count` (integer): The number of times to retry a failed check
  before declaring it a definite failure.
- `retry-backoff` (float): The base time in seconds for retries.
  Subsequent retries use exponential backoff (e.g., `backoff * 2^(n-1)`).
- `failure-threshold` (integer): The number of consecutive failed checks
  before the target's status transitions from healthy to degraded/unhealthy.
- `recovery-threshold` (integer): The number of consecutive successful
  checks required for a target's status to transition back to healthy.
- `critical-p` (boolean): If `t`, failure of this check is considered
  critical and can make the entire system's aggregated health
  `:unhealthy`. If `nil`, it might only lead to a `:degraded` status.
- `tags` (list): A list of arbitrary tags (keywords or strings) for
  categorization and filtering of checks."

  "Configuration for the Warp Health Orchestrator module.

Fields:
- `aggregation-policy` (keyword): Defines how overall system health is
  determined based on the status of individual checks.
  - `:all`: All checks must be `:healthy` for the system to be
    `:healthy`. If any are `:degraded` or `:unhealthy`, the system
    will reflect a degraded or unhealthy status.
  - `:any-critical`: If any check marked as `critical-p` fails, the
    system immediately becomes `:unhealthy`. Otherwise, non-critical
    failures might lead to `:degraded`.
  - `:majority`: More than half of all monitored targets must be
    `:healthy` for the system to be `:healthy`."

- Removes the check and its state from the orchestrator's internal

- Unregisters the periodic task from the internal `loom-poll` instance.
